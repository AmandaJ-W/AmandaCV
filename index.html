          <p>I'm an educator and instructional design student with technical skills and international professional
            experience. I bring tenacity, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

            I have experience in curriculum development, educational material creation, and integrating tech to enhance
            learning experiences. My tech skills include HTML5/CSS, JavaScript, Java, and SQL.</p>
          <br>

            user-centered educational tools that not only meet the needs of learners but also function seamlessly across
            various platforms.

            <h2>Why do I do this?</h2>
            <p id="popupText">
              After nearly a decade in the field, I was drawn to the powerful role technology plays in education. This
              motivated me to deepen my skills in software development with a
              focus on enhancing learning experiences. My knowledge in instructional design has made me feedback and
              evaluation-focused, equipping me to design and refine
              digital tools that truly respond to student or stakeholder needs. This perspective, along with my hands-on
              experience with students, enables me to create solutions that are
              both meaningful and effective in fostering engagement and growth. I am truly passionate about learning and
              infinitely curious, and have dedicated my life to it.

                  I graduated from an intensive full-stack coding course, specializing in developing dynamic web-based
                  software systems using the Java programming language.
                  I successfully completed multiple individual projects and contributed to numerous collaborative team
                  projects.

                <p>I earned a post-graduate teaching certificate from the Universidad Pontificia de Comillas, where I
                  studied key education and learning theories, as well as bilingual curriculum innovation, through

                  I conducted my own workshops on bilingual education for first- and second-year students and program

                  <li>My area of interest was specificly learning and memory. Learning and memory research reveals how
                    the brain stores information,
                    enhancing educational methods, treatment for memory disorders, and overall cognitive health.</li>
                  <li>Learning and memory research helps develop personalized, tech-driven tools and teaching strategies
                    that enhance retention, engagement, and adaptive learning experiences.</li>

                    - West Lafayette not only trains students with an
                    understanding of Psychology, but also combines it with other
                    sciences. The department offers research and education
                    opportunities across a wide range of psychology topics. As an
                    undergraduate psychology student, I assisted in learning and memory research in

              <p>As part of a two-course sequence in Learning Experience Design (LXD), this project represents the
                prototype phase of the design thinking process.
                Using a case study of 6th grade students as the instructional context, I created a low-fidelity mockup
                of
                a one-hour e-learning module designed to improve learner performance on a
                targeted instructional challenge. I made sure to design the module with their needs and preferences in
                mind, based on information collected in the learner analysis and subsequent empathy maps and personas.
                The mockup includes 26 screens, representing the introduction, content delivery, summary, and
                assessment,
                and incorporates multimedia
                and interactive elements to enhance learner engagement. It was developed with attention to visual and
                graphic design principles, usability best practices,
                and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles. This prototype builds on earlier deliverables,
                including a defined learning objective and a <a href="docs/ELearning Storyboard.pdf" target="_blank"

                and demonstrates how design thinking can be applied to create accessible, effective, and user-centered
                digital learning experiences.</p>
