            What I'm up to lately: I continue to work with the Ostrander IT Committee to update and maintain the website. Recently, we have improved 
            our pavilion booking system, optimized navigation, and added a Community tab that provides updates about what is going on in the village. 
            Lastly, and most importantly, I am evaluating the entire website to ensure its compliance with WCAG 2.2 standards for government websites.
            Additionally, I am currently taking a WordPress course in order to reinforce and improve my skills as a WordPress Developer.
